# SIC

run the following commands in your terminal:
1. make -f makefileSICASM
2. make -f makefileSICLoader

## Disclaimer:
Neither object nor the binary code run on any of the commonly known hardware platforms because special hardware needs to be fabricated for this ISA, which to the best of my knowlege in not made. This architecture was created for educational purposes.

## Acknowledgements:
This code is developed based on assembler algorithm given in the book *System Software - An introduction to systems programming* by Leland L Beck and D Manjula. The SIC and SIC/XE architectures are developed by Beck for the purpose of teaching system software.
